An old calculator found in an electronics fair contained a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) tube, with six "7 segments" digits.
Since the calculator was broken i decided to test whether the display was still functional and to my surprise it was, so
what else could i do if not make it into a clock?

## VFD test

## Multiplexing

## Conclusion
